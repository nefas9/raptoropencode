"""ModelScorecard — per-model reliability tracking across decision classes.

See package docstring (``__init__.py``) for the design overview.
This module owns the persistence shape, event recording, and the
trust-policy query (``should_short_circuit``).

Persistence shape (JSON, ``out/llm_scorecard.json`` by default)::

Concurrency: all writes go through :func:`_with_lock`, which holds
an ``flock`` on the sidecar for the duration of read-modify-write.
Multi-process raptor runs can update independent cells without
losing each other's increments. The lock file is the sidecar
itself — no separate lock file to manage.
